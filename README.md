# Survival Analysis
Survival analysis is widely used to show the risk of patients, and especially Cox proportion hazard (PH) model was used for over 50 years that was proposed by Sir David Cox. Therefore, I used R to construct the model for the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval and its p-value as data frame using coxph and other function.

## Cox Proportion Hazard Model (Cox regression)

## Fine-Gray Hazard Model (competing risk regression)
